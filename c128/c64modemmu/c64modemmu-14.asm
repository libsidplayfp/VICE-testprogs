; This is a c64 mode mmu test to see if any of the c128 mode roms exist in c64 mode.
;
; test confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   green  = none of the c128 roms exist in c64 mode
;   blue   = one of the c128 roms exist in c64 mode
;   yellow = two of the c128 roms exist in c64 mode
;   orange = all of the c128 roms exist in c64 mode
