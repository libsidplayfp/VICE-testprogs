; This is a c64 mode mmu test to see which vicii color memory bank is used in c64 mode when having vicii color memory bank 0 mapped in.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black = vicii color memory bank 0
;   white = vicii color memory bank 1
;   cyan  = something weird is going on with vicii color memory
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
