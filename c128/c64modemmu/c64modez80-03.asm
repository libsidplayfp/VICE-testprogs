; This is a c64 mode test to see if the z80 can change access the vicii color map at $d800-$dbff AND $1000-$13ff through in/out.
;
; test confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, but could not get into c64 mode
;   violet = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, no access to vicii color map at all
;   blue   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, access to vicii color map only at $1000-$13ff
;   yellow = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, access to vicii color map only at $d800-$dbff
;   brown  = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, access to vicii color map at $1000-$13ff AND $d800-$dbff
