; This test might need to be revised, DO NOT USE THIS TEST FOR NOW!!!
;
; This is a c128 mode test to see if in z80 mode the mmu registers $ff00-$ff04 are accessable through in/out.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black   = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white   = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan    = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, NONE of the $ff00-$ff04 registers are available through in/out
;   violet  = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ONLY the $ff00 register is readable through in/out
;   blue    = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ONLY the $ff00 register is writable through in/out
;   yellow  = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ONLY the $ff00 register is readable AND writable through in/out
;   brown   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ONLY $ff01-$ff04 registers are available through in/out
;   pink    = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, the $ff00 register is readable and all of the $ff01-$ff04 registers are available through in/out
;   grey    = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, the $ff00 register is writable and all of the $ff01-$ff04 registers are available through in/out
;   l. blue = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, the $ff00 register is readable and writable and all of the $ff01-$ff04 registers are available through in/out
;   red     = something went very wrong during the test
