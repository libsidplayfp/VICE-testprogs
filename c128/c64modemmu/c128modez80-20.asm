; This is a c128 mode z80 test to see what we get if we access $04xx through i/o using in/out when $0000-$0fff is shared memory and we are in bank 1,
; do we get $04xx bios, do we get $04xx ram bank 0, do we get $04xx ram bank 1, do we get $d4xx ram bank 0, or do we get $d4xx ram bank 1.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got $04xx BIOS
;   violet = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got $04xx RAM bank 0
;   blue   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got $d4xx RAM bank 0
;   yellow = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got $04xx RAM bank 1
;   brown  = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got $d4xx RAM bank 1
;   red    = something went very wrong during the test
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
