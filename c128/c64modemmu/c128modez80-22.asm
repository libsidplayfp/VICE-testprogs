; This is a c128 mode z80 test to see if the $d040-$d3ff mirrors of $d000-$d03f work with the z80 in/out.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ONLY $d000-$d03f works
;   violet = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ONLY $d040-$d0ff is a mirror of $d000-$d03f
;   blue   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ALL of $d040-$d3ff is a mirror of $d000-$d03f
;   red    = something went very wrong during the test
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
