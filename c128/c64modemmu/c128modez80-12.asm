; This is a c128 mode test to see if in z80 mode the mmu PCRA, PCRB, PCRC and PCRD are accessable through memory access to $ff01-$ff04.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, NONE of the $ff01-$ff04 mmu registers work
;   violet = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, SOME of the $ff01-$ff04 mmu registers work
;   green  = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, ALL of the $ff01-$ff04 mmu registers work
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
