; This is a c64 mode mmu test to see what happens when p0 and p1 are mapped to the same target page in bank 0, what is read in the target page.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;

; colors:
;   black  = #$33 in target page
;   green  = #$55 in target page
;   cyan   = #$aa in target page
;   violet = something unexpected in target page
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
