; This is a c128 mode test to see which vicii color memory bank the z80 can access.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, $1000-$13ff AND $d800-$dbff current vicii color memory bank
;   violet = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, $1000-$13ff vicii color memory bank 1, $d800-$dbff vicii color memory bank 0
;   blue   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, $1000-$13ff vicii color memory bank 0, $d800-$dbff vicii color memory bank 1
;   yellow = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, $1000-$13ff AND $d800-$dbff vicii color memory bank 1
