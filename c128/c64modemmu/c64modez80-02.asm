; This is a c64 mode test to see if the z80 can change I/O registers even when c64 mode I/O is NOT mapped in.
;
; test confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, but could not get into c64 mode
;   green = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, able to change I/O regs even though c64 mode I/O is NOT mapped in
;   yellow = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, able to change I/O regs with in/out, AND (somehow) with memory access
;   blue   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, got to c64 mode, not able to change I/O regs at all
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
