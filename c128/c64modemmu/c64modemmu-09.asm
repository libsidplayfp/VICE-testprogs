; This is a c64 mode mmu test to see what happens when p0 and p1 are mapped to the same target page in bank 0, what is read in p0 and p1.
;
; test confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = #$33 in p0, #$33 in p1
;   white  = #$33 in p0, #$55 in p1
;   cyan   = #$33 in p0, #$aa in p1
;   violet = #$55 in p0, #$33 in p1
; drk blue = #$55 in p0, #$55 in p1
;   yellow = #$55 in p0, #$aa in p1
;   brown  = #$aa in p0, #$33 in p1
;   green  = #$aa in p0, #$55 in p1
;   grey   = #$aa in p0, #$aa in p1
; lte blue = something unexpected in p0 or p1
;
