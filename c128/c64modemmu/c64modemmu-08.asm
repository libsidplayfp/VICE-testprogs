; This is a c64 mode mmu test to see what is at the target page in bank 0 when p0 is mapped to the target page in bank 1.
;
; test confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = something went wrong with p0 translation in c128 mode
;   white  = something went wrong with p0 translation in c64 mode
;   green  = we got #$aa from target page
;   violet = we got #$55 from target page
;   blue   = we got #$33 from target page
;
; Test made by Marco van den Heuvel
