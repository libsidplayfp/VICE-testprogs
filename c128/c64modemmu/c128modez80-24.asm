; This is a c128 mode z80 test to see what we get when we use in/out on $d7xx when the mmu i/o bit is disabled.
;
; test to be confirmed on real hardware
;
; colors:
;   black  = was not able to switch on the z80
;   white  = got z80 switched on, but no z80 bios present
;   cyan   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got RAM at $d7xx
;   violet = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got z80 bios at $d7xx
;   blue   = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got a constant value
;   yellow = z80 on, z80 bios present in c128 mode, we got whatever the vicii leaves on the bus
