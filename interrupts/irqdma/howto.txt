RUN

After some minutes the border gets grey (success) or flashed (failure).
Test number/address is shown, as is reference and measured value in case
of failure. Detected CIA type (old/new) is also shown.

test*.prg use reference data measured with a real C64 (irqX.dump).

irqX_dtv.dump are measured with a PAL DTV3 (detected as old CIA);
tests 3 and 3b give the same results as C64.

Use record*.prg to measure your own data (stored at $2000-$A000).
