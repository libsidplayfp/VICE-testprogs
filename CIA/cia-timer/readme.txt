=========

- four tests using timers of CIA1 and check IRC near the timer underrun
- tests visible on the left side use timer A, tests on the right use timer B
- for upper tests IRQ is disabled, only the IRC is read and displayed
- lower tests enable the timer interrupt and IRC is checked even inside the IRQ handler
