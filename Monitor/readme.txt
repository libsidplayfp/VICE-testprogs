dummytest
---------

contains all opcodes that produce dummy reads or writes on the 6502

configure the emulators you want to compare at the top of the makefile

use "make test" or "make testnohist" to produce log output, which you can then
inspect in a text editor and/or compare against each other with your favourite
diff tool.
