these are for the unexpanded VIC - i.e. they don't work if you have a memory expansion.


The order from left to right is

black / white
red / light red
cyan / light cyan
purple / light purple
green / light green
blue / light blue
yellow / light yellow
orange / light orange
so then green would be at index 8 indeed.

I also notice that yellow is also very greenish (compared to light yellow.)
It could well be that newer NTSC VICs don't have this exaggerated phase difference.

(on NTSC) green is looking rather like cyan. This appears to be the case on a real
VIC also. The 'normal' colors (2-8) have a phase error on NTSC compared to their
lighter variations (9-15) - this is due to how the color signal is generated on the chip.
PAL does not have this issue since there the phase errors cancel out more or less.
