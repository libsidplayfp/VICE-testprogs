this is the beginning of converting the lorenz testsuite into a format that can 
be assembled using "64tass" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/), and then 
fix/extend certain tests along the way.

goals:
- make all tests run on PAL and NTSC
- make all tests work with old and new CIA
- improve tests for illegal opcodes to make them work on all CPUs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the original code uses the following way to wait for border area. this is not
  very robust an unnecessary complex ....

           lda $d011
           bmi ok
wait
           lda $d012
           cmp #30
           bcs wait
ok

  ... thus replace it by the following, which is shorter (and will also work
  for NTSC)

wait
           lda $d011
           bpl wait

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
individual TODOs:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

start.s:

    - cant be assembled using 64tass right now because of missing directives:
        .lbl
        .var
        .goto

aneb.s
    - add detection for the ANE "magic constant" and fix test accordingly
trap1-15.s
    - add detection for the ANE "magic constant" and fix test accordingly

icr01.s
    - currently only works for "old" CIA. add detection and fix accordingly
cia1ta.s
    - currently only works for "old" CIA. add detection and fix accordingly
cia1tb.s
    - currently only works for "old" CIA. add detection and fix accordingly
    - add detail results (like cia1ta.s)
cia12a.s
    - currently only works for "old" CIA. add detection and fix accordingly
    - add detail results (like cia1ta.s)
cia2tb.s
    - currently only works for "old" CIA. add detection and fix accordingly
    - add detail results (like cia1ta.s)
