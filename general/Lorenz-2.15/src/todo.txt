this is just the beginning of converting the lorenz testsuite into a format
that can be assembled using "64tass"

the org directory contains the original sourcecode and a copy of "turbo macro
pro". to convert the sourcefiles do this:

- load tmp.prg, start by sys8*4096
- <- (arrow left) then l to load a sourcefile
- <- (arrow left) then w to write a sourcefile in petscii format
- convert the result to ascii using petcat

some things must be manually changed since 64tass can not handle them (or its
behaviour is not exactly like the original tass)

    - the original tass evaluates expressions strictly from left to right. you
      should double check this. sometimes you will get errors that can be solved
      by using braces properly :)
    - !* is used in some places to make sure the resulting address will be 16 
      bit. its usually safe to convert it to *
    - some test seem to abuse a bug of the original turbo assembler, which makes
      the labels used in the first .block globally available. if you get a "not
      defined look "jmp loop"" error move the respective label out of the .block

- the original code uses the following way to wait for border area. this is not
  very robust an unnecessary complex ....

           lda $d011
           bmi ok
wait
           lda $d012
           cmp #30
           bcs wait
ok

  ... thus replace it by the following, which is shorter (and will also work
  for ntsc)

wait
           lda $d011
           bpl wait
