Printing Data According to a Previously Defined Format: sa = 1

A secondary address of 1 invokes the formatting features of your printer. The data to be
printed is arrayed according to a previously specified format using sa = 2. If you should
transmit a string of data when sa = 1 is in effect and there is no formatting data in the
printer's memory, then the data string is printed exactly as it is received.

When formatting string data from the computer, a skip, CHR$(29), must be sent to
delimit the end of a string being edited to a field. Leading blanks are stripped off a
string; therefore, to print a blank alpha field you must transmitÂ·a shifted blank,
CHR$(160). The alpha field is then right padded with blanks as shown below.

Example:

10 OPEN 2,4,2   : rem store formatting data
20 OPEN 1,4,1   : rem print formatted data
30 PRINT#2,"AAA   AAA   AAA"
40 PRINT#1,"ABC"CHR$(29)CHR$(160)CHR$(29)"DEF"
50 CLOSE 2:CLOSE 1

Results in:

ABC             DEF

Defining a Programmable Character: sa = 5

A secondary address of 5 allows you to create a custom character of your own. This
programmable character is initialized with this secondary address.
