VDC Timing test based on "Some preliminary data on VDC timing"
by Steven L. Judd / Andreas Boose from Commodore Discovery Issue # 1 


Note the original basic program included in the above magazine was corrupted. The ML stuff was OK.
Based on what I could recover I've completed the basic program, and it produces similar results on a real c128
to the original article so it's probably close enough if not the same.
Either way, the code I've added to Vice approximates the timing produced by my re-written program on a real c128.

To use:
- Disable TDE
- Enable virtual device traps
- Launch x128 from this testprogs directory
- LOAD "V*",8,1
- LOAD "TT*",8
- RUN
- (wait, or switch to warp)

Results should approximately match screenshot off real c128 found with this test program.



TODO:
- combine the ml and basic into one program so it's less fiddly to launch
- add separate tests for fill & copy operations, because common sense suggests a copy should take twice as long as a fill
