Double pixel text mode with 16x24 characters with attributes.
64us/313 lines pal timing, if it's 312 only, then there's no
sync at all, as the sync is placed at the row and there's no
time to latch.
The cursor is in the top left but it does not blink. If the
sync is moved one row earlier, then it does with the same
frequency as the right side of the screen, which looks empty
now.
The screen address is latched at the end of screen, if it's
changed one cycle later then everything is shifting by one
depending on the timing.
The underline is configured to be line 7, the bottom of the
screen displays the alternate charset.
This test needs a 64K VDC.
