Single pixel text mode with 16x16 characters in mono.
Exact 64us/312 lines pal timing.
The cursor is in the top left corner inverting the top
and bottom 4 lines of @.
The green area is the vertical blanking. It ends at
first line of text area and starts at first line after it.
The raster bug has no relation to the position of horizontal
blanking or the position of horizontal sync signal, it's
always at the same position.
The font is expanded using semi graphic mode.
