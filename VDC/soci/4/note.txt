Double pixel text mode with 16x24 characters with attributes.
64us/625 lines pal interlace timing.
The cursor is in the top left and blinks fast.
Every second line is blinking, even if it's looks empty or
as a white bar on the picture or with different color,
it's all white.
The color bar on top is green + red flashing every other
frame, but it's just mixed with flickering as the electron
beam is to thick to make up individual lines.
Attributes are applied on chars, and underline is line 7.
This test needs a 64K VDC.
